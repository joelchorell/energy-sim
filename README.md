# ⚡ EnergySim

**EnergySim** is a backend API that simulates electricity production and demand balance over a full year (8,760 hours).  
It models solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear generation — including realistic seasonal and regional variations.

Built with **FastAPI** and **Python**, EnergySim is designed as the backend for an upcoming interactive web app that visualizes how different energy mixes affect grid stability.
